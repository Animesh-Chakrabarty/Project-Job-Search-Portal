We’re looking for an exceptional developer to continue building our front-end and work alongside our front end and full stack developers. This role is 100% remote but you will need to be available at least for a few hours in US Eastern or Pacific time zones every day during kick offs.\n\nClue uses data and AI to provide actionable insights that construction companies use to integrate, automate and optimize their operations.\n\nOur software is used by dozens of the US largest construction firms, we're growing rapidly, and we're backed by one of the world’s largest construction organizations.\n\nWe are now looking for an excellent React.JS developer to help us build our web console and platform. The ideal candidate is someone who is passionate about building reliable, performant and scalable website using React.js components.\n\nWe want an amazing React.js Developer to join our back-end development team\n\nYour mission is to …\n\n→ To build our front end web console, mostly in React. You will integrate our internal APIs use by our existing mobile and web apps.\n\n→ Work alongside our back end developers implementing algorithms, analyzing our clients’ telematics data to generate the relevant insights.\n\n→ Use a wide range of AWS services, including Lambda serverless instances, Redshift, and more.\n\nYou fit to us if …\n\n→ You have 3+ years of experience in React and Front-end development. Could be in\n• communication and collaboration tools (e.g., social networks, communications, VOIP etc.)\n• SaaS, enterprise software, business analysis or data\n• hardware or machinery related\n\n→ You are intimately familiar with React, Javascript, Linux, Rest APIs, AWS and SQL. You ideally some experience with frontend coding.\n\n→ You have a track record of building stable, performant infrastructure..\n\n→ You have worked at a startup and a fast-moving, sometimes hectic but always fun environment.\n\nConstruction: the $20 trillion market looking for a clue\n\nThe numbers are staggering. Construction is one of the world’s largest industries. 10% of the world’s GDP goes into construction.\n\nIt’s also one of the most inefficient industries in the world. While almost all other industries became more efficient, construction became more inefficient. Since 1945, US productivity in manufacturing, retail, and agriculture has grown by as much as 1,500 percent, but productivity in construction has barely increased at all.\n\nThis is about to change. Construction companies are finally waking up. They are spending more on IT than ever before. The amount of venture capital investment into construction startups jumped 4x in the last year alone, passing $2bn.\n\nTo sum it up: Construction is one of the world’s biggest and least efficient industries yet to be disrupted. It is an open field, a wide blue ocean for the best entrepreneurs, startups and investors. The time to get into this market is now.\n\nOur hiring process: simple and fast.\n\nPlease use the Apply function on our recruitment website and attach your CV. We typically give you our response within 48 hours. We prefer to have a video interview within a week after your application.\n\nLocation: Remote\n\nStart date: Immediate\n\nCompensation: The salary for this role is dependent on location and seniority. We aim to pay in the top 10% of salary range. We also offer a home office allowance, compute and internet allowance.",
